# Celo Dev Tools Hub 🛠️

An open-source **Farcaster Mini App** that brings together essential tools for developers building on the Celo blockchain.  
Accessible directly inside **Warpcast**, this hub makes testing, onboarding, and debugging faster and easier.  

## ✨ Features

- **Faucet Tracker** – View all active Celo testnet/mainnet faucets with limits & availability.  
- **Gas Fee Estimator** – Real-time gas tracking with suggested transaction windows.  
- **Persona Wallet Generator** – Create JSON-based personas for wallet simulators.  
- **Transaction Visualizer** – Timeline and graph view of wallet activity.  
- **RPC / Node Health Checker** – Monitor RPC endpoints for uptime and latency.  

## 🎯 Problem

Developers today waste time searching for scattered tools, unreliable faucets, and manual setups.  
This friction slows down onboarding and experimentation on Celo.  

## 🚀 Solution

The **Celo Dev Tools Hub** centralizes critical utilities into a single Farcaster Mini App:  
- No more searching for links  
- No need to install anything — directly usable inside Warpcast  
- Open-source, modular, and community-driven  

## 🛡️ Mission

Our mission is to accelerate adoption of the Celo ecosystem by lowering the barrier to entry for builders.  
With a one-stop toolkit, developers can test faster, debug smarter, and focus on impactful dApps.
